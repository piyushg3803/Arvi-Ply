        "body": "Plywood is commonly used in furniture, architectural details, and décor projects. When picking a plywood, one must know all essential information to make the right choice. However, one often gets overwhelmed by the information specified on plywood labels. Understanding the label with information on plywood sizes and thickness, as well as other characteristics, are important to make an informed decision. Understanding Plywood Sizes Plywood sizes refers to the length and width of a sheet of plywood. The standard size is 4x8 feet. Other plywood board sizes include 8x3 feet, 7x4 feet, 7x3 feet and 6x4 feet for projects that require furniture specific sizes. Interpreting Plywood Thickness Along with the size, the thickness is also mentioned which helps determine the strength, stability, and suitability for a particular job. Plywood could be as thin as 4 mm to as thick as 25 mm or more. The standard thickness includes 6mm, 9mm, 12mm, 16mm, 19mm and 25 mm. The thicker plywood is stronger and more durable and is recommended for load carrying like flooring or roofing whereas the thinner plywood is more flexible and lightweight and is recommended for cabinet backs or decorative panelling. Specialty Plywood Grades In addition to plywood sizes and thickness, the specialty grade of the plywood like marine grade, fire retardant grade, E-0 emission grade, etc. may be mentioned on the labels. This helps us decide where we can use the type of plywood grade. Marine Grade plywood Made using waterproof glue and higher-quality veneers and can withstand moisture. This type of plywood is suited for indoor projects and kitchens, boats and outdoor projects. Fire-Retardant plywood Suited for buildings, hinges and panelling to resist ignition and reduce the speed of spread of fire. E-0 Emission plywood With low formaldehyde emissions, this grade is suitable for families that want to focus on a healthy living environment. Other Label Information Besides plywood board sizes, thickness, and grades, plywood labels also include Core Type: This refers to the type of material used in the core of the plywood. The type of core used determines weight, stability, and holding of fasteners in the plywood. Type of Glue: The type of glue used determines the performance of the plywood in the surrounding environment. Country of Origin: Specifies where the plywood was made. How to Choose the Right Plywood Project Requirements Consider the strength, durability, appearance and place where the plywood will be used. Example - for a subfloor, a strong durable, thicker plywood with lesser focus on appearance would be required unlike one used in living room furniture.Match the Size to the need Choose plywood board sizes that minimize waste and reduce the need for additional cuts. Check the Grade Make sure the grade of the plywood matches the quality, strength and appearance requirements of the project. Specialty Features Check if the project involves possible exposure to water, heat, or fire and consider speciality grades like Marine grade plywood or fire retardant.Although interpreting plywood labels may seem daunting at first, knowing the information provided like plywood sizes and thickness, grade and other aspects helps one select the right plywood for desired needs.",

        "title": "Customizing Plywood Sizes for Unique Design Projects",
        "body": "There are some standard sizes of plywood sold of which 4x8 plywood is the common one. The average size of a plywood sheet is 4x8 feet with surface area of 32 square feet. This size is popular for wall sheathing, flooring, and furniture-making applications. A plywood sheet is also available in smaller sizes like 7x4 feet, 7x3 feet, and 6x3 feet. The thickness of plywood typically ranges from 6mm to 25 mm and at times more. The choice of thickness depends on structural requirements of the project. Thicker plywood is used for load-carrying purposes, whereas thinner plywood may be quite enough for decorative purposes. Standard sizes of plywood, like 4x8, are convenient for most projects, but there are many times when one needs to have custom sizes. Tips to Cut and Adjust Plywood Sizes Plan Your Cuts Carefully Before cutting and adjusting the sheets, plan the layout of the project with exact dimensions. First measure the area in which the plywood will be installed. Make proper sketches of design with placement of each piece of plywood and then cut accordingly. Use Proper Tools Cutting plywood requires accuracy, and proper tools will make a difference in the cuts. Make use of a circular saw with a fine-tooth blade as it gives a clean, straight cut. In places where the cut is small or complex, a jigsaw could be used. Make sure the saw blade is new and intended for cutting plywood to minimize splintering and tear-out. Avoid Splintering If one needs to make a cut in plywood sheets 4x8, one could experience 'splintering' along the edges of a cut. This can be prevented by sticking painter's tape along the line of cut before making the cut. One could also use a utility knife. This shallow groove will guide the saw blade through the cutting process and inhibit the top veneer from tearing. Support the Plywood During Cutting Place the plywood on a solid workbench or saw horses, ensuring that each side of the cut is supported so the sheet does not bend or break under the saw. It is recommended to slightly raise the plywood off the surface when using a circular saw to keep from cutting into the workbench. Consider Finishing Edges The cut plywood may require smoothening by sanding to attain an excellent finish. This helps remove the rough spots or splinters. Edge banding or veneer tape can be used over the exposed layer for a finished look.

        "title": "How to Check Plywood Quality.",
        "body": "Understanding Different Grades of Plywood Plywood comes in a variety of grades, with different applications, quality, resistance to moisture and other environmental factors. These grades determine which plywood best serves specific purposes.  Moisture-Resistant Plywood (MR) MR plywood is not waterproof, making it suitable for indoor furniture when budget is a constraint. Boiling Water-Resistant Plywood (BWR) BWR plywood can withstand short periods of exposure to water and is used in areas where exposure to moisture is less. It has low strength and durability compared to Marine Plywood. Marine Plywood This is the one of the best water-resistant plywood and is best used indoors for utmost quality and in boats and outdoor furniture that is constantly exposed to dampness or extreme conditions. Knowing plywood grades is one of the essential steps if the question is how to check plywood quality.Checking the Surface of the Plywood One must check the plywood surface when evaluating the quality of plywood. A good quality plywood sheet comes with a smooth surface that is free from cracks, dents, or splinters. One must run their hand along the plywood surface to determine the quality. If your plywood surfaces are rough, it is not quality plywood that will make good furniture. Also check if the edges of the plywood sheet contain any gaps or voids between the layers. Quality plywood shall always have uniform layers without any gaps meaning it gives more strength and durability. Gaps in these layers reduce structural integrity of the plywood which makes it weaker over a period of time.Another important aspect when it comes to how to check the quality of plywood is that the plywood should be uniform in thickness from end to end. The product should not bend or warp when used in making furniture.Check the Core Material Plywood is made up of layers of thin pieces of wood veneer, bonded with a core in the middle. A good quality plywood sheet will have a sound and strong core. A softwood core is soft and does not offer toughness as compared to hardwood core plywood. Hardwood core plywood is stronger and can bear heavier loads, making it apt for load bearing furniture like wardrobes and kitchen cabinets. A high-quality plywood sheet should be composed of an odd number of layers like 3, 5, 7 layers. The more layers there are, the more strength and resistance there are to warping. These layers must be bonded well to show no gaps. The cross-grain alignment gives additional strength to the plywood and prevents it from getting warped. Check the adhesives used on plywood The glue determines the moisture resistance and strength of plywood according to its grade. To understand how to check plywood quality, one should consider the adhesive used. For high-quality plywood, especially BWR and marine plywood, phenol-formaldehyde resin is used in the adhesive glue to provide water resistance. MR plywood is bonded with urea-formaldehyde resin, which is not recommended for wet conditions. When buying, check to see if the adhesive meets your needs. For usage in a kitchen or bathroom, ensure that the plywood is bonded with adhesive that is waterproof, also known as phenol-formaldehyde resin. Boiling Test Boiling water test is a simple test to determine how to check the quality of plywood, especially if one is purchasing BWR or marine plywood. Place a small piece of plywood into boiling water for 72 hours and evaluate its shape, structure, and strength. If there is no warping or delamination, it means the plywood quality is good. If it starts to delaminate, crack, or soften, the plywood quality is not fit for water-prone areas.Brand and Certification Check When one decides to purchase plywood, check the certification of goods and if they meet the requirements of ISI (Indian Standards Institute). ISI-marked plywood is quality tested plywood that meets industry benchmarks.Understanding how to check the quality of plywood is essential to choose the best plywood for furniture or construction projects to last long. Careful inspection of the surface, checking the core material, glue used, and a simple test that one can do from the comfort of one’s home helps one pick the best plywood. Choosing the right plywood from Royale Touche not only increases the structural integrity of furniture but ensures it lasts for a long period.",

        "body": "Plywood Types That Are Excellent for Wardrobes When selecting plywood for wardrobes, it's essential to first understand each type of plywood, its strength, durability and resilience in a given climatic conditions along with budget consideration. to ensure creating long lasting, sturdy wardrobes. MR (Moisture-Resistant) Plywood MR ply is moisture resistant but it is not waterproof and works where humidity is low and water exposure is less. This is a commonly chosen plywood for wardrobe and cupboards in bedroom or living room walls if budget is a constraint. BWR Plywood This stands for Boiling Water-Resistant that is best suited for use in locations where moisture is present but not constantly present like in the kitchens or bathrooms. BWR plywood can tolerate water splashing but is not waterproof, making it a less suitable material for cabinetry near water sources or for humid areas. Marine Plywood The marine-grade from Royale Touche is the toughest and most resistant to water. When talking about wardrobes, marine-grade plywood can be a wonderful option especially if one is living by the beach or there is a high humidity level in the region. It is also the touted plywood, making it ideal for wardrobes. Factors to Consider When Choosing a Plywood Thickness and Durability The thickness and size of the plywood determines the durability of the wardrobes and cupboards. For a wardrobe, 19mm plywood is standard thickness as it is strong and durable in structure. It is stable to hold shelves, hang rods and contents without bending or warping over time. Plywood of 12mm to 16mm is used for cupboard doors and panels. This thickness makes the plywood strong, durable while making it easy to work with.",

        "body": "Steps by Step Process of Plywood ManufacturingPlywood Manufacturing Process involves following steps which are given as follows: Timber selection and preparationThe first step in the production of plywood is the proper choice of quality timber. The most commonly used woods in plywood manufacturing include hardwood species like eucalyptus, teak, birch, and oak, as well as softwood species like pine and spruce. Proper selection of timbers is necessary to decide on the final strength and quality appearance of the finished plywood. Royale Touche used 100% eucalyptus due to its suitability for making high quality plywood. Once the logs are selected, they undergo debranching, or outer layer removal as part of plywood making process The debarked logs are then cut into smaller sizes for ease of processing in subsequent steps. Peeling the Logs into Veneers The timber is then turned into thin layers known as veneers. Logs are mounted on large machines called lathes and then rotated against a sharp blade. As the log spins, thin sheets of veneer are formed due the peeling of the timber surface into a continuous roll. The thickness of the veneer depends on how the plywood is intended to be used. Once the veneer is made, they are cut uniformly and pre-processed for other processing purposes. Veneer sheets are a central part of making plywood since they represent layers that form the plywood when they are glued. This step is a part of the plywood manufacturing process. Drying the Veneers As logs have moisture in them, veneer sheets are wet after peeling. Further, these sheets are treated in vacuum pressure treatment chambers (VPT) for imparting resistance to termites and borers. The following step of the plywood making process is drying the veneers to decrease its moisture content which is essential for proper bonding between the glue and wood and prevent delamination or warping of the plywood. The veneers are dried using large industrial dryers to minimize moisture as part of the plywood manufacturing process. This ensures stability in plywood to resist environmental changes. Gluing and Layering the VeneersOne of the most important steps in plywood production is gluing. Dried veneer sheets are coated with adhesive and layers are placed one over other in alternating grain direction which makes the plywood strong as well as resistant to warping or cracking under pressure. Phenol-formaldehyde adhesives are used in most instances for water-resistant plywood. Interior-grade plywood makes use of urea-formaldehyde glue. Pressure on the plywood sheet is evenly dispersed with uniform thickness as the veneers are aligned with extreme care.",

        "title": "What are the advantages of Plywood?",
        "body": "Major Benefits of plywood Strength and Durability One of the most important advantages of plywood are strength and durability. Plywood is engineered from several thin layers (plies) of wood veneer, where each ply is placed with an angle from the one below it, thereby making it extremely resistant to splitting or warping. Plywood has cross-grain composition where the weight is spread uniformly on the board. It is stronger compared to solid wood and can withstand heavy loads. It is used structurally for flooring, roofing, and wall sheathing. Plywood will not chip or crack easily with heavy use and impact. It is a perfect material to be used in areas with high traffic in homes or a commercial setting. Royale Touche plywood is manufactured using top-of-the-line veneers, ensuring it to be one product that provides maximum strength and longevity in applications. Versatility: A Material for All Purposes Plywood is versatile and comes in a variety of grades, thicknesses, and finishes, making it ideal for a variety of applications-from constructional work to furniture making and even internal décor. Plywood can be used in flooring, wall paneling, furniture-making, cabinetry, doors, or ceiling usage. It can also be used when renovating a home or creating a new space. Plywood comes in a variety of finishes like natural wood grain and textured surfaces providing one the desired finish for the project. Whether one wants a shiny or rough finish, the plywood can be made to suit their design needs. At Royale Touche, one can find what is required for his or her specific project due to the variety of plywood options meant for varying needs. Cost-Effective: Quality Without the High Price The primary advantage of plywood is they can be a cost-effective option. Plywood is one of the best choices for those who look for good quality material to make their furniture and other interiors without any compromise on durability and strength. Plywood is cheaper than solid wood. Its engineered construction ensures long-term value, presenting a very wide range of options to fit any budget. Royale Touche plywood also maintains premium aspects of craftsmanship as well as quality. Resistance to Shrinking and Warping: Ideal for Any Environment The risk of using solid wood is that it tends to contract and expand or warp because the humidity or temperature might change. Plywood, on the other hand, has a very minimal tendency to expand or shrink or warp because of the multiple layers used. The cross-grain structure of plywood provides minimal effect of humidity and temperature on the stability of this material. Solid wood, however, expands or contracts, while plywood retains its shape and strength. As the plywood is layered, it resists warping or cracking under tension and compression forces. Royale Touche's well-crafted plywood ensures one experiences stable, consistent performance even in high-humidity or temperature-sensitive environments.",
